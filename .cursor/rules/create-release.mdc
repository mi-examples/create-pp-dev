# Create Release Workflow

When the user asks to **Create release** (or "create tag", "release tag"):

## Steps

1. **Read version from package.json** – Get the `version` field (e.g. `0.5.5-beta.2`).

2. **Strip beta suffix** – Remove `-beta.*`, `-alpha.*`, `-rc.*` etc. Examples:
   - `0.5.5-beta.2` → `0.5.5`
   - `1.0.0-rc.1` → `1.0.0`
   - `2.3.4` → `2.3.4` (unchanged)

3. **Tag name** – Use `v` + stripped version: `v0.5.5`.

4. **Create tag on latest origin/main** – Run:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git tag v<version> origin/main -m "Release v<version>"
   ```
   Example: `git tag v0.5.5 origin/main -m "Release v0.5.5"`

5. **Push tag** (if user wants to publish):
   ```bash
   git push origin v<version>
   ```

## Notes

- Tag is created from `origin/main`, not from the current branch.
- Do not push the tag unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Confirm the version and tag name with the user before creating/pushing.
